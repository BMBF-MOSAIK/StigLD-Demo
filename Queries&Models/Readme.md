The queries given here are SPARQL queries encoded as HTTP requests. An HTTP client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) can be used to run these requests. The Postman folder contains the collections of different requests, so that it can be run in a loop using the [Postman Collection Runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/). 

AllRequests.postman_collection.json in the postman folder simulates agent coordination using stigmergy, while RandomWalk.postman_collection.json simulates the random walk agents.

The models folder contains RDF models of the shop floor representations. onlineDemo_TestModel.TTL is the model used for the purpose of the demonstration.
