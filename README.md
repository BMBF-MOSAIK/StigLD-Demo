# StigLD-Demo

This project has four components:
1. The stigFN server: implements the custom SPARQL functions for evolution of Stigmata.
2. Medium server: Injects evolution queries before the user queries to maintain consistency of world view before responding to a user query.
3. Web-viz: Visualises the dynamics of the demonstrations on a browser window
4. Queries&models: SPARQL queries implement the agent behaviour, while the model files create a representation of the shop floor in RDF.

Following the instructions from the readme of individual folders, and then open http://localhost:4200 on a (preferably) chromium based browser.
